    "# 036-KMP Speed up motif finding\n",
    "## Shortening the motif search\n",
    "- The standard approach to find whether one sequence appears as a substring of another is to slide the pattern along the text one position at a time and check for matches.\n",
    "- If a mismatch occurs at the 100th position, we would need to go back 99 positions and start comparing again, which is inefficient.\n",
    "- The computational complexity of this naive approach is approximately O(len(S) × len(T)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "- Let\n",
    "    - t = ACGTACGT\n",
    "    - s = TAGGTACGTACGGCATCACG\n",
    "\n",
    "- In s[5:12], there are 7 matching characters.\n",
    "- However, s[12] = G while t[7] = T, so a mismatch occurs.\n",
    "- One might consider restarting the scan from s[6], but this is unnecessary.\n",
    "- We already know that s[6:9] does not start with A, so it cannot match the prefix of t.\n",
    "- If we start from s[9], we observe that\n",
    "- t[0:4] = t[4:8] = ACGT,\n",
    "- and since we already know s[12] ≠ t[7], a mismatch will inevitably occur at t[3].\n",
    "- Therefore, s[9] should also be excluded as a candidate starting position, and the next valid starting point should be s[14].\n",
    "- This idea forms the basis of the Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP) algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "- Given a string s of length n, compute its Failure array P.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "- For a string s:\n",
    "  - A prefix is defined as s[1:j]\n",
    "  - A suffix is defined as s[k:n]\n",
    "  - (for simplicity, we consider 1-indexing)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The failure array P[k] is defined as:\n",
    "the length of the longest substring s[j:k] that is equal to some prefix s[1:k-j+1],\n",
    "with the restriction j ≠ 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The restriction j ≠ 1 is necessary because if j = 1, then s[j:k] = s[1:k], which would always match the prefix, resulting in P[k] = k for all k.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although this definition is somewhat difficult to understand\n",
    "- It is equivalent to the partial match table used in the KMP algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative explanation\n",
    "- Consider the substring s[1:k].\n",
    "- Among all prefixes of this substring and suffixes of the same length,\n",
    "the maximum length where they are equal is defined as P[k].\n",
    "- By convention, P[1] = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- In essence, the task is to compute the partial match table (failure function) for a string of length n.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "- For s = \"ABABAB\", the failure array is:\n",
    "\n",
    "|index|pattern| Prefix + others | others + suffix | Failure array value(match_length) |\n",
    "|:---:|:-----:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:-------------------:|\n",
    "| 0 | A | - | - | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 | AB | A + (b) | (a) + B | 0 |\n",
    "| 2 | ABA | A + (ba) | (ab) + A | 1 |\n",
    "| 3 | ABAB | AB + (ab) | (ab) AB | 2 |\n",
    "| 4 | ABABA | ABA + (ab) | (ab) + ABA | 3 |\n",
    "| 5 | ABABAB| ABAB + (ab) | (ab) + ABAB | 4 | \n",
    "\n",
    "- From this table, we can see that for indices [2–5],\n",
    "instead of restarting the match from the beginning,\n",
    "- if s[match_len + 1] = s[current_position], we can simply extend the existing match."
